Fireactions is an orchestrator for GitHub runners. BYOM (Bring Your Own Metal) and run self-hosted GitHub runners in ephemeral, fast and secure [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) based virtual machines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's been multiple improvements with a lot of breaking changes. The current stable version is **v2.0.0**. Please use this version for production environments.

Several key features:

- **Scalable**

  Pool based scaling approach. Fireactions always ensures the minimum amount of GitHub runners in the pool.

- **Ephemeral**

  Each virtual machine is created from scratch and destroyed after the job is finished, no state is preserved between jobs, just like with GitHub hosted runners.

- **Customizable**

  Define job labels and customize virtual machine resources to fit Your needs.
