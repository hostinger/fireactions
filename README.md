BYOM (Bring Your Own Metal) and run self-hosted GitHub runners in ephemeral, fast and secure [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) based virtual machines.

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

## Features

- Autoscaling based on received GitHub webhooks for `workflow_job` events.
- Support for multiple GitHub organisations
- Fast startup time of 15-30 seconds (from webhook received event to job running).
- Security by design: ephemeral virtual machines, no persistent storage. No need to worry about secrets left on the virtual machine.
- Support for `x86_64`, `arm64` architectures and multiple Linux kernel (LTS) versions.
- Support for multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04).
- VM resource allocation (vCPUs, RAM) based on GitHub job labels.

## Usage

To start using self-hosted GitHub runners, add the label to your workflow jobs:

```yaml
<...>
runs-on:
- self-hosted
- <PREFIX>[.GROUP][.FLAVOR] # e.g. fireactions.group1.1vcpu-1gb, fireactions.group1, fireactions
```

Job labels identify the type of virtual machine to create for the Job. Label must begin with prefix and must be followed by the group and flavor name, separated by a dot. If neither group nor flavor is specified, the default group and flavor will be used.

See [Configuration](./docs//configuration.md) for more information on how to configure the default job label prefix, groups and flavors.

## Metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics are exposed on the same port and can be accessed at `/metrics` endpoint.

### Server

Currently, the following metrics are exposed:

| Metric name                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fireactions_server_up | Whether the Fireactions server is up and running. |
| fireactions_store_scrape_errors_total | Total number of errors encountered while scraping the store. |
| fireactions_store_resources_total | Number of resources in the store (nodes, jobs, runners, groups, flavors) |

Example Prometheus scrape configuration:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: fireactions-server
  static_configs:
  - targets:
      - 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Roadmap

- Support for right-sizing virtual machines based on actual (historical) GitHub job resource usage via [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
